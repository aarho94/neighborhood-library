Project steps:

Coding:
Start by creating a Java project following the Maven folder structure.
Create appropriate Java packages to organize your classes.
Create the necessary classes and methods according to the requirements:
Create a Book class with appropriate properties (e.g., id, ISBN, title, isCheckedOut, checkedOutTo).

Create a Library class to manage the inventory of books.
Implement methods in the Library class to:

Check out books.
Check in books.
Display available books.
Display checked-out books.
Ensure that your code adheres to naming conventions and is properly formatted.
Use meaningful variable and method names.
Include necessary comments to explain your code.
User Interface:
Create a console-based user interface to interact with the library system.
Implement the store home screen with options to:
Show available books.
Show checked-out books.
Exit the application.
Implement functionality to prompt users for actions like checking out or checking in books.

Test your application to ensure it works as expected.
Test various scenarios, including:
